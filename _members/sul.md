I have bachelor’s in Life Sciences from Presidency University, Kolkata; Currently pursuing Masters in Cognitive Sciences. Since my college days I have been interested in studying about the organ which controls my body and its complex mechanisms fascinates me. Helps me wonder my thoughts and understand my mind. I'm interested in Emotions, Memory, Neuro degenerative diseases. I have done Internship work on Psycholinguistics perspective of emotional recall text in collaboration with Aishwarya Gawate under the supervision of Dr. Varsha Singh and Dr. Sumeet Agarwal. Master's Project -- Currently trying to work  on how specific emotions are expressed through language. Well, when I’m not studying I do a lot of things, I read, I listen to songs, mostly I watch movies and series. NETFLIX is my comfort zone. I hang out with my friends as well. Sometimes I dance to my heart’s content. There is nothing I don’t like to do except solving my sleep issues.
