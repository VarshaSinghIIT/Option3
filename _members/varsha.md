My research is aimed at understanding cognitive and affective processes in decision making. Major part of my work is cross-disciplinary, on-going research in the clinical domain (a) neural basis of decision making and episodic memory in MTL epilepsy (collaboration with Neuroscience, AIIMS) (b) cognitive and affective impairment in spinal cord injury (with Indian Spinal Cord Injury) (c) Decision making in anxiety disorder (Psychiatry, AIIMS) (d)sleep loss and cognitive impairment, specifically decision making deficits. In collaboration with Centre for Economic Studies and Planning (CESP, JNU), I investigate how emotions affect deception, information-sharing, creativity, and outcomes of labor market including sex differences in salary, productivity. In collaboration with the engineering departments, the focus is on improving psychophysiological measures of respiratory control (Electrical Engineering), motor control and movement analysis (Computer Science), with an emerging interest in analyzing affect in text. When not busy running experiments, I spend time understanding how science, scientific research grows across different fields mainly math, sciences, engineering (scientometrics).
