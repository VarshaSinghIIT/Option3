Hritik is a 2nd-year Cognitive Science student at IIT
Delhi and a true Psychology enthusiast at heart. He completed his
undergrad in B.Sc. Psychology (Hons.) from CHRIST (Deemed to be
University), Bangalore. After that he gained experience working under
different labs, companies, and projects as a researcher for 2 years. His
exciting experiences include working as a behavioural science
researcher, game design researcher, psychometric consultant, and product
researcher. Later, he worked at Vision Sciences Lab (under Dr. Julian de
Freitas) and Embodied Social Cognition Lab (under Dr. Nicole Noll) at
Harvard University, which motivated him to pursue the path of research
and academia. His research interests include the areas of social and
moral cognition, emphasizing topics such as the theory of mind, empathy,
and shared understanding of emotions, among others. He likes to
contextualize his work in the evolutionary science and picture. When not
curious about all of these with flooding questions, he likes to spend
his time doing origami, reading books, performing theatre, and exploring
museums and monuments.
