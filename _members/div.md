I am an RCI Licensed clinical psychologist, interested in the areas of Memory and Decision Making, and clinical psychotherapies. Currently, I am working on cognitive-affective integration in Epilepsy in children. I have research experience in working with special populations including refugees in Delhi, and patients with mental illness specifically dissociative disorders. In my free time, I like to read and watch a lot of TV shows.
