 I have a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Life Sciences from Presidency University. I am currently working on documenting sex-differences in affect and decision making in healthy people and people with depression. I am interested in exploring the functional underpinnings of emotions and their dysregulation in people with mental health disorders. In spare time, I love travelling and playing chess.
