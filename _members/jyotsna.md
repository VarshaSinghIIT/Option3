I received my B.SC. in Zoology from Miranda House, University of Delhi, and my M.Sc. in Microbiology from St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata. Previously I worked as a Khorana scholar in the Zhao Lab at UW Madison and Indian Academy of Science’s summer research fellow at NIBMG, Kalyani. I started my graduate school in 2020 at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, in collaboration with AIIMS Delhi, in the field of cognitive neuroscience. My Ph.D. work focuses on exploring the effect of aging and neurodegeneration on decision-making in the Alzheimer’s disease rat model.
I like to cook, knit, and crochet in my spare time.
