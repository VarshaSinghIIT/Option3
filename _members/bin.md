Having earned a Masters degree in Life Sciences (Maj. Neurobiology) from Sophia College, Mumbai, I started my career as a Neuro-scientist at a startup in 2021, while being a guest lecturer for UG students. After a years experience in the corporate field, I switched gears to academia by working for Prof. Shubha Tole at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Reserach as a project fellow. Being in an academic environment made my interest in neuroscience grow ardently. Having dissected this empirical field "one neuron at a time" in my previous job, I am now interested in using the top down approach to study cognition and behavior in Prof. Varsha Singhâ€™s lab. Here, I look at gender specific processing of affect and decision making using fNIRS along with Ankit Jha (PhD student).
