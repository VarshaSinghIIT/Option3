I am a third year Graduate student with Dr. Varsha Singh working on an interdisciplinary project in collaboration with AIIMS, New Delhi. I have bachelors degree in Life Sciences from Miranda House, University of Delhi and Masters in Zoology from SPPU, Pune. My PhD question mainly focuses on understanding alterations in decision-making in affective disorders such as Anxiety with the underlying sex differences, using animal models. The aim is to examine region-specificity as a potential determinant of attribute and phase-specificity in cognition and affect/valence dysregulation in decision-making. When not engaged with cognitive or neuroscience, my brain ponders about Evolutionary theories. And in my spare time away from my rats and laptop, I like to read, paint and travel.
