# Highlights

{% capture text %}
The group primarily uses behavioral experiments, combining
these with imaging (fNIRS, structural MRI) to understand cognitive
deficits in clinical conditions (neurological and psychiatric disorder).
To control for environment influences or to study of cognitive deficits
specific to a clinical disorder, the group collaborates with labs to use
animal models (rodents). A multidisciplinary approach is needed to
understand the hard problems such as the mind-body, or
brain-behavior-cognition, therefore group members are selected from
clinical psychology and biology, encouraged to collaborate with
engineering and sciences.
